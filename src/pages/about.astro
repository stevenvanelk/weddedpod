        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Why We Do This</h2>
        <p>
          Two things we are confident in: marriage and wedding planning. And
          what do you know, we're professional wedding photographers who happen
          to be married! Not only did we successfully plan our own wedding,
          we've helped hundreds of other couples do the same. We aren't wedding
          planning experts in every category, but we do know many talented
          people who are. So you'll hear wise, wedding industry experts talk
          about how to best plan your wedding whenever we run into a subject we
          don't feel like we have expertise to talk about.

            If you just love all things wedding and marriage, we are your best
            stop for your daily commute or something to listen to while you are
            around the house. Jenn loves to help her couples with wedding
            planning. There is so much information out there that it's
            exhausting just trying to figure out where to look. Steven loves to
            make people laugh and tell stories, so it's no surprise that he
            loves to host podcasts. <br />

            This podcast came about to help couples plan for their wedding and plan
            for married life. We both enjoy listening to podcasts and hope that this
            can be one you look forward to a few times a month.
