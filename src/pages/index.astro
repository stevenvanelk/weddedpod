            We're Steve &amp; Jenn Van Elk. We've been married since 2008.
            That's a long time in doggy years, so we are pretty much an old
            married couple. If you are an avid listener, you probably realize we
            are lovers of nerdy things, beer, and the outdoors... and not to get
            too blue, but we're also lovers. Our love language is to make fun of
            ourselves and each other and for that reason we are both full of
            joy. We have two kids and two businesses. Our kids, Nora &amp; Iain
            have no idea that we podcast but I'm sure if they knew they'd be
            severely embarrassed. Besides making sure to make our kids feel
            understandingly mortified of their nerdy parents, we are running
            Jennifer Van Elk Photography, destination and local wedding
            photography, located in Indianapolis, and Bespoke Tone, which is a
            post-processing service for photographers, videographers, and
            podcasters.

          Two things we are confident in: marriage and wedding planning. And
          what do you know, we're professional wedding photographers who happen
          to be married! Not only did we successfully plan our own wedding,
          we've helped hundreds of other couples do the same. We aren't wedding
          planning experts in every category but we do know many talented people
          who are, so you'll hear wise leading wedding industry experts talk
          about how to best plan your wedding.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you just love all things wedding and marriage, we are your best
          stop for your daily commute or something to listen to while you are
          around the house. Jenn loves to help her couples with wedding
          planning. There is so much information out there that it's exhausting
          just trying to figure out where to look. Steven loves to make people
          laugh and tell stories, so it's no surprise that he loves to host
          podcasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          This podcast came about to help couples plan for their wedding and
          plan for married life. We both enjoy listening to podcasts and hope
          that this can be one you look forward to a few times a month.
