Writing thank-you notes doesn’t have to be a post-wedding slog. With a short formula and a good system, you can knock them out quickly and actually enjoy it.

## When to Send

- **Shower gifts:** within **2–3 weeks** of the event.
- **Wedding gifts:** aim for **6–8 weeks** after the wedding (up to **3 months** is still gracious).
- **Early or mailed gifts:** send within **2 weeks** of receiving.

## The 3-Sentence Formula

1. **Open warm**: greet them by name and thank them for the **specific gift or effort**.
2. **Say how you’ll use it**: one concrete detail (where it’ll live, what it funds, when you’ll enjoy it).
3. **Close personal**: nod to your relationship or the day you’ll see them next.

> “A specific thank you” + “a specific use” + “a specific connection” = done.

## Tracking Makes It Easy

Keep a simple list so you don’t second-guess yourself later.

| Name(s)           | Gift                     | Date Received | Note Sent |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- | --------- |
| Alex & Jordan Lee | Stand mixer              | 6/10          | ✅ 6/20   |
| Priya Menon       | Cash ($150)              | 6/12          | ✅ 6/22   |
| Morgan Rivera     | Travel fund via registry | 6/15          | ⏳        |

## Tricky Situations (At a Glance)

- **Cash / gift card:** thank them for their **generosity** and share what it will **help you do**.
- **Group gift:** thank the **group by name** and mention the organizer if there was one.
- **No physical gift / presence only:** thank them for **celebrating** with you and any help they gave.
- **Late gift:** same formula—skip any mention of timing.
- **Duplicate/returned gift:** thank them sincerely; reference how it fits your home/life (no need to explain the return).
- **Donation to charity:** thank them for the **donation in your honor** and why the cause matters.
- **Vendor thank-yous:** keep it short; if you loved them, add a **review promise** or link to a posted review.

## Handwritten vs Digital

- **Handwritten** feels personal and is preferred for most wedding gifts.
- **Digital** (email/text) is fine for quick situational thanks (e.g., last-minute help, photos a friend shot).
- If handwriting is a barrier, mix methods: handwritten for close family/major gifts, digital for others.

## Pro Tips

- **Batch in 15-minute sprints:** 5–10 notes per session keeps handwriting fresh.
- **Print return addresses & use forever stamps** to speed things up.
- **Personalize the middle sentence**—that one detail does all the heavy lifting.
- **Sign consistently:** use both names; add last names if it clarifies for extended family.
- **Keep a photo of your stationery** and text it to long-distance relatives who love seeing it.

**Bottom line:** Keep it specific, sincere, and short. A few thoughtful sentences beat a long, generic paragraph every time.
