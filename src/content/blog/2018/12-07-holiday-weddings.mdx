Holiday-weekend weddings can be magical—built-in themes, festive moods, and extra days off. They can also get expensive and complicated fast. Use these tips to make the most of a Christmas, New Year’s, July 4th, Labor Day, Memorial Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Easter, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, or Valentine’s Day wedding—minus the chaos.

## 1) Availability, Pricing & Contracts

- **Holiday premiums:** Expect higher rates and staffing surcharges; bake overtime into the budget and contract.
- **Minimums & blackouts:** Venues may raise F&B minimums or close entirely (think Thanksgiving/Christmas).
- **Load-in/out:** Confirm drop-off and pickup windows when vendors are closed the next day.
- **Staffing backups:** Ask how teams cover illness or travel delays during peak holidays.

## 2) Travel, Hotels & Guest Experience

- **Costs & crowds:** Flights/hotels surge. **Hold room blocks early** and post booking deadlines.
- **Save-the-dates:** Send **8–12+ months** ahead (12–18 for Christmas/NYE destinations).
- **Traffic & events:** Parades, fireworks, and marathons affect parking/shuttles—pad the timeline.
- **Family traditions:** Expect lower RSVPs around Thanksgiving, Easter, Mother’s/Father’s Day.
- **Kids:** Consider on-site childcare or kid activities during school breaks.

## 3) Timeline, Light & Curfews

- **Daylight:** Winter holidays mean **early sunsets**—plan portraits earlier or do a **first look**.
- **NYE specifics:** Midnight moments require **overtime** (band/DJ/venue) and clear bar cutoffs.
- **Noise rules:** July 4th brings traffic and sound; check local curfews and ordinances.

## 4) Theme, Décor & Florals

- **Light touch:** Use the holiday as color/texture inspiration, not a costume (unless that’s your vibe—hi, Halloween).
- **Seasonal swaps:** Some florals/rentals book out; ask for season-friendly alternatives.
- **Venue décor:** Trees/wreaths might be preinstalled—can save budget or clash; request photos.

## 5) Food & Beverage

- **Guest expectations:** Cozy classics for Thanksgiving; lighter menus for July heat.
- **Observances:** Mind Lent/Passover/Ramadan timing; offer inclusive options.
- **Local laws:** Some dates restrict alcohol sales or hours—confirm early.

## 6) Permits, Policies & Insurance

- **Public spaces:** Parks/beaches/rooftops often need **holiday permits**—apply early.
- **Sparklers/fireworks:** Only where legal, ideally with licensed pros. Verify venue rules and insurance.

## 7) Communication & Expectations

- **Be clear:** Add a website FAQ with travel notes, weather plan, dress code, and childcare info.
- **Gifting:** Overlapping holidays? Offer group gifts or cash funds to simplify.
- **Sensitivity:** Holidays hit differently; keep the tone welcoming and inclusive.
