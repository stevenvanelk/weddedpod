Sometimes less really is more. Smaller guest counts can mean bigger impact, deeper connection, and more budget for personal details.

## 1) Guest List
- **20–50 people:** Just closest family and friends.
- **Clear invites:** Be transparent with why you’re going small.

## 2) Venue Options
- **Private homes:** Cozy and personal.
- **Boutique restaurants:** Built-in catering and ambience.
- **Scenic spots:** National parks, gardens, or rooftops.

## 3) Budget Priorities
- **Upgrades:** With fewer guests, splurge on food, photography, or attire.
- **Custom favors:** Personal touches shine more at small weddings.
- **Décor:** Thoughtful details feel more intimate.

## 4) Guest Experience
- **Activities:** Wine tastings, boat rides, or shared cooking classes.
- **Seating:** Long family-style tables foster connection.
- **Timing:** Shorter days or extended weekends work well.
