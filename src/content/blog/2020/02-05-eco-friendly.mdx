Eco-conscious couples can plan weddings that are gorgeous and sustainable. Here’s how to reduce waste while keeping the day stylish.

## 1) Venue & Transportation
- **Local venues:** Reduce travel emissions by choosing a central location.
- **Shuttles & carpools:** Group transport lowers carbon footprint.
- **Outdoor spaces:** Less décor needed when nature sets the scene.

## 2) Attire & Jewelry
- **Vintage gowns/suits:** Preloved fashion saves resources.
- **Ethical jewelers:** Source conflict-free stones or heirloom resets.
- **Rentals:** Tuxes, bridesmaid dresses, and décor items can be reused.

## 3) Food & Beverage
- **Local + seasonal menus:** Support nearby farms and reduce shipping.
- **Compost stations:** Ask caterers about eco-waste management.
- **Reusable tableware:** Avoid single-use plastics.

## 4) Décor & Florals
- **Potted plants:** Guests can take them home.
- **Dried flowers:** Long-lasting and repurposable.
- **Minimalist design:** Focus on statement pieces vs. excess.
