From live-streamed ceremonies to custom hashtags, tech now plays a big role in weddings. Here’s how to make it enhance—not distract from—the day.

## 1) Livestreaming
- **Virtual guests:** Platforms like Zoom or YouTube allow faraway family to tune in.
- **Equipment:** Pro videographers or tripod setups—test Wi-Fi ahead.
- **Privacy:** Use password protection for links.

## 2) Apps & Communication
- **Wedding websites:** Share schedules, maps, and FAQs.
- **Guest apps:** Digital RSVPs, group chats, and push notifications.
- **QR codes:** Easy access to menus, programs, or seating.

## 3) Social Media
- **Hashtags:** Unify guest posts.
- **Photo-sharing apps:** Collect candid shots in one place.
- **Unplugged moments:** Balance tech with intentional no-phone zones.

## 4) Guest Accessibility
- **Closed captions:** Help older or hard-of-hearing guests follow livestreams.
- **Recorded video:** Share later with those who miss the moment.
