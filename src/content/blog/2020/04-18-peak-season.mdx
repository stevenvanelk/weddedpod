Summer and early fall are wedding high season—venues book fast, vendors charge premiums, and travel fills up. Here’s how to plan smart.

## 1) Book Early
- **Venues/vendors:** Secure 12–18 months in advance.
- **Travel:** Room blocks and flights jump in price quickly.
- **Photographers/entertainers:** Peak weekends are first to go.

## 2) Budget Adjustments
- **Premium pricing:** Expect surcharges on florals, tents, and staffing.
- **Negotiation:** Flexibility on weekday weddings can save thousands.
- **Prioritize vendors:** Spend big where it matters most.

## 3) Guest Experience
- **Heat plan:** Fans, shade, and plenty of water for summer events.
- **Traffic/tourism:** Popular destinations may be crowded—add buffer time.
- **Communication:** Send save-the-dates 12+ months ahead.
