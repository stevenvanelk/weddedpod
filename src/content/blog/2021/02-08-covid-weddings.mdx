Pandemic weddings taught couples how to adapt—think micro-guest lists, livestreams, and creative safety measures. If you’re planning a 2021 celebration, here’s how to balance safety and style.

## 1) Guest Count & Venue
- **Scaled guest lists:** Keep it smaller; local guidelines may shift.
- **Outdoor venues:** Safer and often more flexible with spacing.
- **Hybrid setups:** Livestream for those who can’t travel.

## 2) Safety Measures
- **Masks & sanitizers:** Branded masks or stations double as décor.
- **Seating pods:** Seat families/households together.
- **Food service:** Plated meals beat buffets for hygiene.

## 3) Contracts & Contingencies
- **Flex clauses:** Ensure rescheduling policies are in writing.
- **Insurance:** Coverage for cancellations or health-related issues.
- **Backup dates:** Keep a plan B (or C).

## 4) Communication
- **Transparency:** Keep guests updated via website/app.
- **Comfort options:** Respect RSVPs declining due to health.
- **Virtual favors:** Send digital thank-yous or gift cards.
