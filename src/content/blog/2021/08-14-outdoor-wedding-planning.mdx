Fresh air, sunsets, and wide-open backdrops—outdoor weddings are stunning, but they demand extra planning.

## 1) Weather Prep
- **Tents + heaters/fans:** Always have climate control options.
- **Rain plan:** Communicate clearly where guests will go.
- **Timing:** Consider shade for midday ceremonies.

## 2) Guest Comfort
- **Bug spray + sunscreen:** Subtle guest baskets help.
- **Shoes:** Provide heel protectors or note terrain in invites.
- **Hydration:** Water stations and shaded seating are key.

## 3) Décor & Lighting
- **Natural elements:** Let the scenery lead your palette.
- **Lighting:** String lights, lanterns, or candles for ambience.
- **Sound:** Outdoor speakers or mics for vows.

## 4) Permits & Rules
- **Noise ordinances:** Know the cutoff times.
- **Public spaces:** Secure permits early.
- **Clean-up:** Confirm who handles it post-event.
