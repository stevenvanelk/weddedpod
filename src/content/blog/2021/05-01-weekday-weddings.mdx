With venues packed on weekends, weekday weddings offer big savings and more availability—without sacrificing the fun.

## 1) Budget Wins
- **Lower venue costs:** Weekday rates are often discounted.
- **Vendor flexibility:** DJs, florists, and caterers may charge less midweek.
- **Stretch budget:** Put savings toward photography or décor.

## 2) Guest Considerations
- **Travel time:** Give guests advance notice to arrange PTO.
- **Shorter events:** Consider earlier ceremonies or compact timelines.
- **Local perks:** Midweek hotel blocks can be cheaper.

## 3) Vibe & Flow
- **Casual chic:** A Thursday night wedding feels fresh and relaxed.
- **After-party:** Bars or rooftops are less crowded midweek.
- **Extended weekend:** Kick off early for a long celebration.
