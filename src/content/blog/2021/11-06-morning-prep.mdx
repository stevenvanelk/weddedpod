How you start your wedding morning shapes the whole day—calm, chaotic, or somewhere in between. Here’s how to set yourself up right.

## 1) Timeline & Space
- **Hair + makeup:** Pad with 30–60 extra minutes.
- **Room choice:** Bright natural light helps makeup + photos.
- **Stagger arrivals:** Avoid too many people at once.

## 2) Food & Hydration
- **Breakfast:** Protein + carbs to fuel through the ceremony.
- **Snacks:** Keep quick bites (fruit, bars) nearby.
- **Hydrate:** Champagne is fun, but water matters more.

## 3) Mindset & Vibe
- **Music playlists:** Calm or upbeat depending on mood.
- **Personal rituals:** Meditation, journaling, or a letter exchange.
- **Photo moments:** Robes, toasts, and first looks with parents.

## 4) Logistics
- **Emergency kit:** Safety pins, sewing kit, stain remover.
- **Dress transport:** Keep it hung and steamed.
- **Point person:** Assign a friend or coordinator for small issues.
