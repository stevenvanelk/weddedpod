2022 became the year of the wedding boom—bigger guest lists, bold designs, and unapologetic celebrations after years of uncertainty. If 2020 was intimate and 2021 was hybrid, 2022 was all about going big.

## 1) Guest Lists & Venues
- **Maxed out:** Guest counts surged back to 200+.
- **Venue crunch:** Many couples booked Thursday–Monday to snag a date.
- **Tents + estates:** Demand for outdoor venues stayed strong.

## 2) Bold Design
- **Statement florals:** Installations, arches, and ceilings of blooms.
- **Color explosion:** Goodbye neutrals, hello jewel tones and neon pops.
- **Personal branding:** Monograms, crests, and signature cocktails.

## 3) Experiences
- **Immersive food:** Food trucks, chef stations, multi-course pairings.
- **Entertainment:** Multiple acts (band + DJ + live painter).
- **After-parties:** Lounge vibes extended the night.

## 4) Guest Comfort
- **Hybrid touches:** Livestreams still included faraway friends.
- **Health kits:** Sanitizer and masks offered quietly at stations.
- **Flexible RSVPs:** Couples stayed sensitive to comfort levels.
