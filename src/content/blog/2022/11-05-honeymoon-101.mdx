The honeymoon is your first adventure as a married couple. Plan it wisely so it’s stress-free, romantic, and unforgettable.

## 1) Timing
- **Immediate vs. delayed:** Some couples jet off next day; others wait a few months to save money or avoid burnout.
- **Mini-moon option:** Quick getaway now, bigger trip later.

## 2) Budget
- **All-inclusive resorts:** Predictable and easy.
- **Adventure travel:** National parks, safaris, road trips.
- **Luxury splurge:** Villas, overwater bungalows, five-star dining.

## 3) Logistics
- **Passports + visas:** Check expiration dates early.
- **Vaccinations + insurance:** Stay safe and covered.
- **Packing list:** Don’t forget chargers, meds, or travel docs.

## 4) Romance & Relaxation
- **Balance:** Mix sightseeing with downtime.
- **Surprises:** Plan a secret excursion or spa treatment.
- **Disconnect:** Limit phones, focus on each other.
