Trends come and go, but timeless weddings never feel dated. Here’s how to design a celebration that looks as good in 30 years as it does today.

## 1) Palette & Décor
- **Neutrals with depth:** Ivory, champagne, navy, emerald.  
- **Classic florals:** Roses, peonies, orchids.  
- **Statement pieces:** Chandeliers or lush centerpieces over clutter.  

## 2) Fashion
- **Clean silhouettes:** Simple gowns age better than trend-heavy styles.  
- **Tailored suits:** Sharp fits never go out of style.  
- **Quality over quantity:** Invest in pieces you’ll cherish.  

## 3) Photography & Storytelling
- **Film + digital:** Hybrid coverage captures timeless warmth.  
- **Black-and-white edits:** Classic elegance in every album.  
- **Story-driven:** Focus on candid emotion, not just posed perfection.
