A flawless wedding doesn’t just happen—it runs on a timeline that’s smart, flexible, and guest-friendly. Here’s how the pros do it.

## 1) Ceremony & Photos
- **Golden hour portraits:** Work backwards from sunset.  
- **First look or not:** Decide early—it impacts the whole flow.  
- **Family photos:** Pre-organize shot lists to save stress.  

## 2) Reception Flow
- **Short transitions:** Avoid long downtime between ceremony and dinner.  
- **Layered entertainment:** Break up speeches, dances, and courses for pacing.  
- **Dance floor anchors:** Plan “moments” every 45 minutes to keep energy up.  

## 3) Flexibility
- **Pad time:** Add 10–15 minutes to each major transition.  
- **Communicate:** Keep vendors synced with updates.  
- **Appoint a point person:** One voice directing the flow.
