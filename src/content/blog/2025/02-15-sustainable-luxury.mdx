Couples in 2025 want weddings that feel indulgent yet mindful—where eco-conscious choices meet elevated design. It’s not burlap-and-mason-jar eco anymore; it’s luxe, intentional sustainability.

## 1) Conscious Design
- **Reused installations:** Floral arches repurposed into reception centerpieces.  
- **Upcycled fashion:** Bridesmaids in rental gowns, grooms in tailored rentals.  
- **Eco-chic rentals:** Glassware, linens, and décor designed for reusability.  

## 2) Elevated Food & Drink
- **Zero-waste catering:** Creative menus built to minimize leftovers.  
- **Plant-forward dining:** Luxe, chef-driven vegetarian options.  
- **Local sourcing:** Wineries, distilleries, and farms showcased.  

## 3) Legacy Mindset
- **Carbon offsets:** Travel balanced through reputable programs.  
- **Charity gifts:** Donations in lieu of favors.  
- **Heirloom investments:** Jewelry, attire, or décor that lasts beyond one day.
