Big weddings bring big love—and big logistics. From seating charts to RSVP chaos, here’s how to wrangle the crowd.

## 1) Venue Fit
- **Capacity:** Confirm the venue can handle your numbers with fire code limits.
- **Parking + shuttles:** Big guest counts = transport planning.

## 2) Invitations & RSVPs
- **Digital RSVPs:** Cuts postage and data entry.
- **Clear deadlines:** Build a cushion for late responders.
- **Meal choices:** Track dietary restrictions efficiently.

## 3) Seating & Flow
- **Assigned seating:** Smooths catering service.
- **Table sizes:** Mix rounds and longs to fit the space.
- **Traffic flow:** Wider aisles and extra bars reduce bottlenecks.

## 4) Guest Experience
- **Welcome tables:** Extra staff for check-in.
- **Restrooms:** Adequate stalls = happy guests.
- **Entertainment:** Large dance floors and varied music keep energy balanced.

## 5) Staffing
- **Catering ratio:** 1 server per 10–12 guests.
- **Bar service:** At least 1 bartender per 75 guests.
- **Security:** Helpful for crowd control at big events.
