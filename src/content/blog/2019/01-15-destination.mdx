Destination weddings can feel like a dream vacation—sunsets, oceans, and built-in honeymoon vibes. But they come with big logistics to manage. Here’s how to pull one off without losing your sanity.

## 1) Location & Legalities
- **Marriage laws:** Some countries require residency days before you can wed; check if you’ll need a local license or to marry legally at home first.
- **Travel time:** Balance exotic vs. accessible. A 12-hour flight might cut your guest list in half.
- **Weather seasonality:** Avoid hurricane/monsoon seasons.

## 2) Guest Communication
- **Save-the-dates:** Send 12–18 months in advance.
- **Travel guides:** Provide a website with airport info, transfer options, and customs/visa requirements.
- **Group rates:** Share deadlines for discounted blocks.

## 3) Vendors
- **Local vs. fly-in:** Local pros know venues; fly-in vendors add comfort but cost more.
- **Contracts:** Clarify travel fees, per diems, and who books flights/lodging.

## 4) Budget
- **Shipping décor:** Expensive and risky—lean into local rentals.
- **Currency exchange:** Pad budget for rate changes and bank fees.
- **Insurance:** Covers weather, travel delays, and lost luggage with attire inside.

## 5) Guest Experience
- **Welcome events:** Think casual beach bonfire or rooftop cocktails.
- **Excursions:** Group activities like snorkeling or wine tours boost connection.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure elderly guests or families with kids can navigate terrain.
