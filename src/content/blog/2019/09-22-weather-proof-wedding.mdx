From rain to heat waves, weather can throw curveballs on your big day. Here’s how to prepare without panicking.

## 1) Backups
- **Tent rentals:** Reserve in advance; last-minute = pricey.
- **Indoor Plan B:** Always confirm the backup space’s look and capacity.

## 2) Season-Specific Prep
- **Summer:** Fans, shade, hydration stations.
- **Winter:** Heat lamps, blankets, indoor spaces.
- **Spring/Fall:** Tents with removable walls for quick shifts.

## 3) Attire
- **Shoes:** Flats or wedges for grass.
- **Fabric:** Breathable for summer, velvet/wool for winter.
- **Umbrellas:** Match your palette and have them ready.

## 4) Photography
- **Golden hour:** Shifts with season; build flexibility.
- **Rain shots:** Clear umbrellas + reflections = magic photos.
- **Snow:** Build in extra time for movement and warm-up.
