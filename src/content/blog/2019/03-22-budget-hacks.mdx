A wedding doesn’t have to break the bank. With the right priorities and creative swaps, you can save thousands while keeping the day beautiful.

## 1) Venue & Timing
- **Off-peak dates:** Fridays, Sundays, or winter dates are often half-price.
- **All-in venues:** Packages with catering, rentals, and staff save coordination and money.
- **Public spaces:** Gardens and parks require permits but slash rental fees.

## 2) Catering & Bar
- **Food stations or buffets:** Less staffing = lower labor cost.
- **Signature cocktails + beer/wine:** Skip the full open bar.
- **Cake alternatives:** Sheet cakes or dessert buffets.

## 3) Décor & Florals
- **Repurpose florals:** Ceremony arrangements = reception décor.
- **Seasonal blooms:** In-season flowers cost less and last longer.
- **DIY touches:** Candlelight and greenery can stretch the look.

## 4) Photography & Entertainment
- **Shorter hours:** Book 6–8 hours of coverage instead of all-day.
- **DJ over band:** Lower fees, flexible playlists.
- **Photo booths:** DIY Polaroid station for fun without high rental costs.

## 5) Attire & Extras
- **Sample sales:** Designer gowns at 50–70% off.
- **Rental suits:** Saves hundreds vs. custom tailoring.
- **Skip favors:** Put the money toward food or fun experiences.
