If your guest list includes little ones, plan for fun and flexibility so parents can relax and kids can enjoy themselves.

## 1) Ceremony
- **Short & sweet:** Keep it under 30 minutes.
- **Seating:** Reserve back rows for families needing quick exits.

## 2) Reception
- **Kids’ table:** Games, coloring books, or small crafts.
- **Menu:** Kid-friendly food (mac + cheese, sliders, fruit).
- **Entertainment:** Bubble machines, lawn games, or a small movie corner.

## 3) Childcare
- **On-site sitters:** Licensed professionals let parents enjoy the dance floor.
- **Separate room:** Quiet space for naps or overstimulation breaks.

## 4) Communication
- **Clear invites:** Note if kids are invited or if it’s adults-only.
- **Parents’ guide:** Share schedule, menu, and childcare options.
