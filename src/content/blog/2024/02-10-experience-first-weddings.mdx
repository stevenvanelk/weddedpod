2024 couples are shifting from staged perfection to curated experiences—weddings designed to *feel*, not just *look*, unforgettable. Photos matter, but memories matter more.

## 1) Immersive Guest Experiences
- **Interactive food:** Chef stations, mixology bars, DIY desserts.  
- **Entertainment layers:** String quartets at cocktail hour, DJs + live performers at night.  
- **Themed moments:** Lounge-style receptions, cultural showcases, travel-inspired menus.  

## 2) Multi-Sensory Design
- **Lighting & scent:** Candles, florals, and custom scents set mood.  
- **Textures:** Velvet linens, wood tables, rattan chairs—guests *feel* the details.  
- **Sound:** Curated playlists by event phase.  

## 3) Meaning Over Perfection
- **Storytelling décor:** Tables named after milestones, photos woven into design.  
- **Personal rituals:** Toasts, vows, or cultural elements center connection.  
- **Quality over quantity:** Fewer filler moments, more intentional pacing.
