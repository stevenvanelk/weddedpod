Budgeting doesn’t have to feel limiting. Done right, it’s about maximizing joy per dollar and avoiding costly pitfalls. Here’s the pro-level breakdown.

## 1) The 40/20/20/20 Rule
- **40% Venue & catering**  
- **20% Photo + video** (memories > extras)  
- **20% Décor + attire**  
- **20% Miscellaneous (transport, invites, favors, etc.)**  

## 2) Where Couples Overspend
- **Décor duplication:** Renting and buying the same look.  
- **Food waste:** Over-ordering late-night snacks.  
- **Vendor creep:** Hidden fees for overtime, setup, or travel.  

## 3) Smart Saving Strategies
- **Hybrid florals:** Mix fresh with dried/artificial.  
- **Simplified menus:** Fewer entrée choices cut costs.  
- **Weekday rates:** Still cheaper than Saturdays in most cities.
