Guests remember how they felt more than what they saw. In 2024, thoughtful couples are designing weddings around **guest comfort, ease, and joy.**

## 1) Communication
- **Clear invites:** Dress code, weather plan, transport info.  
- **Mobile-friendly websites:** Guests check on the go.  
- **Reminders:** Send texts for shuttles or weather updates.  

## 2) Comfort
- **Climate prep:** Fans, heaters, hydration, umbrellas.  
- **Seating:** Enough chairs—yes, even at cocktail hour.  
- **Dietary inclusivity:** Plant-based, gluten-free, kid-friendly options.  

## 3) Joyful Extras
- **Interactive guest books:** Audio, video, Polaroid notes.  
- **Photo ops:** Creative backdrops beyond the couple.
