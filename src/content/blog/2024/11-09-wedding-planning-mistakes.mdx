Even organized, thoughtful couples fall into common wedding traps. Here’s how to sidestep the biggest ones.  

## 1) Ignoring Buffer Time
- Hair/makeup, transport, and family photos always take longer.  
- Solution: Add **30–60 minutes of padding** everywhere.  

## 2) Blowing the Budget on Décor
- Guests notice food + music more than charger plates.  
- Solution: Reallocate funds to experiences.  

## 3) Forgetting Guest Perspective
- Long gaps between ceremony and reception? Brutal.  
- Solution: Provide drinks, apps, or activities to fill downtime.  

## 4) Skipping Professional Help
- DIY planning saves money but costs peace of mind.  
- Solution: At least hire a **day-of coordinator**.

## Mistakes Checklist
- [ ] Built-in time buffers
