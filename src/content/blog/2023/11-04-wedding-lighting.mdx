Lighting is the unsung hero of weddings—transforming mood, photos, and guest experience. Here’s how to get it right.

## 1) Ceremony
- **Natural light:** Plan timing for golden hour.
- **Candles:** Romantic but confirm open flame policies.
- **Backup:** Have lanterns or LED candles for outdoor spaces.

## 2) Reception
- **String lights:** Classic and versatile.
- **Chandeliers:** Add glamour to barns or tents.
- **Colored uplighting:** Change the whole mood instantly.

## 3) Dance Floor
- **Spotlighting:** Keep focus on the couple.
- **Special effects:** Disco balls, fog machines, or neon signs.
- **Power needs:** Ensure your venue’s circuits can handle it.

## 4) Photography Considerations
- **Even lighting:** Avoid harsh spotlights that wash people out.
- **Dynamic effects:** Ask photographer how they’ll capture.
- **Consistency:** Match your palette for cohesive shots.
