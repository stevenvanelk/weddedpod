Why limit your wedding to one day? Multi-day celebrations let you extend the joy with welcome parties, day-after brunches, and more.

## 1) Common Formats
- **Welcome dinner:** Casual kickoff for guests traveling in.
- **Rehearsal activities:** Not just dinner—think boat rides or wine tastings.
- **Day-after brunch:** Relaxed wrap-up before departures.

## 2) Guest Considerations
- **Communication:** Send schedules early via website.
- **Lodging:** Blocks at hotels or Airbnb clusters help.
- **Budget:** Multi-day = more food, staff, and logistics.

## 3) Personalization
- **Themed events:** Luau, taco night, or black-tie cocktails.
- **Local flavor:** Highlight the destination with cuisine or tours.
- **Dress codes:** Set expectations so guests pack accordingly.
