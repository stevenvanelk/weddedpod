Planning a wedding can feel overwhelming. Between budgets, vendors, and guest drama, stress can creep in. Here’s how to stay calm, centered, and focused on what matters most.

## 1) Build a Realistic Timeline
- **12–18 months:** Ideal for larger weddings.
- **6–9 months:** Possible with decisive planning.
- **Buffer weeks:** Leave breathing room before the big day.

## 2) Delegate
- **Hire a planner or coordinator:** Even day-of makes a huge difference.
- **Family/friends:** Assign tasks, don’t carry it all.
- **Digital tools:** Apps keep RSVPs and budgets organized.

## 3) Take Care of Yourself
- **Exercise & sleep:** Keep routines to manage stress.
- **Date nights:** Protect time with your partner away from planning.
- **Mindset:** Perfection isn’t the goal—celebration is.
