2023 couples are ditching cookie-cutter weddings and leaning into personal, unique touches that reflect their story. Think less “Pinterest-perfect,” more “authentically us.”

## 1) Story-Driven Details
- **Custom vows:** Share anecdotes that feel intimate and real.
- **Family traditions:** Incorporate heritage, rituals, or heirlooms.
- **Playlists:** Build music around your love story.

## 2) Décor & Branding
- **Custom monograms:** Printed on invitations, napkins, even dance floors.
- **Illustrations:** Venue sketches or couple portraits as signage.
- **Signature cocktails:** Named after pets, trips, or inside jokes.

## 3) Guest Experiences
- **Interactive guest books:** Video messages, Polaroids, or audio notes.
- **Food that tells a story:** Favorite date-night dishes or cultural menus.
- **Surprise elements:** Fireworks, outfit changes, or choreographed dances.
