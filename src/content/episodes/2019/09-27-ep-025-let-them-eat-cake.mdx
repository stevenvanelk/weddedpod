This week we're talking all about cake. Why? Because Steve claims he's seeing a new
trend when it comes to cutting the cake. Aside from this supposed new trend, we're
all just talking about everything you want to know about your cake on the day. When
to cut it. How to cut it (which is the number one thing couples ask photographers
on their wedding day). When it will be delivered. Our favorite types of icing. Our
least favorite types of icing. Whether or not holding the cake hostage will keep
your guests at the wedding longer. Also, the proliferation of donut walls across
the world and how they're cutting into cake's big day.
