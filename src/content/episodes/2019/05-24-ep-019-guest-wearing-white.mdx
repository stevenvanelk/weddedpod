On this episode we discuss what you should do if one of your guests tells you they're
going to be wearing white to your wedding. We talk about how you can respond to that
guest politely, and impolitely. We also talk about whether or not it's okay to make
a guest or family member leave the wedding if they show up in white.

Also of note in this discussion, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Family Matters/Steve Urkel,
Boy Meets World, and Wine Country.
