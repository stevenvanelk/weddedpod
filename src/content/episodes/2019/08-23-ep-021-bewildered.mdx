This week we answer questions about bridesmaids and bridal parties. From what gifts
to get them to how you can pick the right people for the job. We're also talking
about the right way to tell a bride that you don't want to be a part of her bridal
party. And we talk a little bit about how a bride should handle that information.
It's not always time to end a friendship.
