This week we had Josh Withers of the Rebel's Guide to Getting Married on the podcast!
Josh isn't just another podcaster, he's also a marriage celebrant in Australia. Josh
is the owner of Married by Josh (his wedding celebrant company) and the co-owner
of The Elopement Collective with his wife. Josh also runs the Celebrant Institute
which helps educate other celebrants. In this episode, Josh came on the podcast to
talk about what it means to be a wedding celebrant and how to turn your wedding ceremony
into a celebration of you! When you get married, you're deciding who you and your
significant other are as a couple and presenting that to the world. So Josh wants
to help you put your best foot forward. He also wants to help you start your marriage
out right! We also talk with Josh about elopements and what it means to be a professional
in the wedding industry!
