We're answering our first ever listener question. If you don't get along with your stepson and he only ever hits you up when he wants money, do you have to go to his out of state wedding? He's been with his fiance for several years and they have kids, some together, some from past relationships... So, do you have to go? Also, he never sent you a formal invite, just verbally asked if you'd want to go...<br />

<br />
We're walking through this question step by step to find out how committed this stepmom
is to being the cool grandma. Sweeties for all.
