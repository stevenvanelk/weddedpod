This is the thrilling follow up to last week's episode where we delved too deep into the minds of guests. Who knows what we awoke in the darkness? Your guests know. They know it well. This week we moved away from the ceremony and onto the reception, the real party. Because, you know, there's no point in throwing a party if your guests aren't going to have a good time. So come get railed with us and afterward we'll all meet up in the closet.
