What are the top 10 biggest regrets you'll have after your wedding? We can't see
into your personal future so we don't really know... But what we can do is dissect
an article that claims to know what people who are married regret the most about
their wedding. Join us on this fun ride into crazy town as we tear apart this article
and then dish on some of our biggest regrets.
<br />
If you want to follow along with the article while we talk about it, then you can
find it on [Wedding Forward](https://www.weddingforward.com/things-brides-regret-not-doing-at-their-wedding/).
<br />
We also briefly talked about an article that purports to be able to tell you the
seven words that'll make you happy in marriage. That article doesn't deliver on the
concept of 7 words. Instead it lists 7 sentences that people say to each other. You
can find that on [Bustle](https://www.bustle.com/p/couples-in-happier-relationships-say-these-7-words-more-often-16813498).
