This week we answer an anonymous listener question. This listener friended their
vendors on facebook, and then found out their florist was making fun of their wedding.
We talk about whether or not you should work with vendors that complain online and
how to avoid unpleasant people. It's important to remember though, that everyone
gets frustrated and complains, so unfortunately you'll never find a vendor that's
never complained a day in their life. You can find people that are nice and who will
keep their complaints private though, and also people who just aren't known to complain.
