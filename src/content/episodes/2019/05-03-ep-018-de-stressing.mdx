This week on Wedded we're talking about de-stressing. As you head out toward your
wedding, or just out toward the rest of your life in general, it's important to take
time to relax and rejuvenate your spirit. Steve does this by trying new beers with
Jenn. So, in this episode, he walks you through the steps you take when tasting beers.
<br />
If you're interested in finding the best glassware for your favorite style of beer,
check [this guide out on Kegworks](https://www.kegworks.com/blog/guide-to-glassware).
I know Steve said you could just google it in the episode, but who wants to waste
time googling?
