This week we talked with Andi Sherman of Something Blue Stylists! We talked a lot
about the importance of hiring a professional makeup artist. There are just so many
things we didn't think about, like the level of professionalism, the cleanliness
of their brushes and products, and their ability to tackle any problem that arises.
Andi also talks to us about her favorite hair styles and the different types of brushes
she uses. And, as the title suggests, she shares a horrifying story about what she
did when her van with her entire makeup kit was stolen a few days before a wedding.
<br />
Jenn and Steve's audio is a little rough in this one. There was a recording snafu.
We thought the things Andi had to say were so good though that it would be worse
not to post this episode than it would be to post it with some not so great audio.
