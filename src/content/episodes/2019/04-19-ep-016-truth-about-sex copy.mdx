In this episode, Jenn and I talk a lot about sex. Coming straight off of a few weeks of talking together on other podcasts, where we made a lot of jokes about sex, we thought it would be a good idea to have a conversation about our first time having sex. Specifically, about the baggage we both brought into the relationship as a result of waiting till marriage to have sex and about how sex isn't always great for both people involved.

We also talk a lot about Steve's sleep paralysis. It's not fun. It's scary and spooky
and terrible.

We mentioned an episode of the Secret Life of Weddings Podcast that we were recently
on in this episode. If you want to hear that episode, it's [Episode 92](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-092-big-boob-brigade-just-winter-engaged-broken/id1288307412?i=1000435044164)
on their podcast feed. We shared some really fun stories there that you'll love to
hear.
