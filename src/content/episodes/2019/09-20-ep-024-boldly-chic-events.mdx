This week we're joined by Lori Solomon and Megan Painter of Boldly Chic Events. We
talk with Lori and Megan about planning a timeless wedding, linens, installations,
florals, and so much more. We also talk a lot about ways to make your wedding have
a bigger impact in this episode and where to put your money to get the most impact
if your budget is limited. Lori and Megan also share stories about tornados and rain
on wedding days. They also talk with us a little bit about late snacks, like sliders
and Chicago style beanie weanies, as well as making Taco Bell runs late at night
to feed to all the guests!
<br />
We talk a lot about a recent wedding that Boldly Chic Events planned and that we
captured. If you want to see some more photos from that event so you know exactly
what we're talking about, then check out [our blog post about that wedding](https://jennifervanelk.com/newfields-wedding-bryana-darnel/)!
<br />
Megan also references a wedding we worked with her back when she was at her previous
job, a wedding where it started raining during the ceremony. If you want to see some
photos from that wedding, then check out [our blog post about that wedding](https://jennifervanelk.com/mustard-seed-gardens-noblesville-wedding-photography-kendra-sam/)!
