This week we're talking about what expenses you can expect to incur when paying for a vendor to travel to your location. We just flew to California to shoot a wedding, so we thought it was a good time to talk about this since it was fresh on our minds. But before we get into that, Steve asks Jenn if 5:30 AM is too early for a wedding ceremony with guests. The spoons come out as we obviously dovetail into a fight about whether or not cereal is a good idea at a wedding. Okay, that probably wasn't obvious... We're not really even certain how we got there. But we did.
