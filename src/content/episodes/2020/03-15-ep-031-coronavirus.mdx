We wanted to take a moment to talk about COVID-19 (perhaps better known as Coronavirus) and how it might affect your wedding planning. Though mostly relevant to people with weddings over the next month or two (and hopefully only that long), there's a lot of stuff that we're talking about with regard to health and safety that's applicable every flu season. People are always getting sick and we all need to wash our hands and cover our mouths when we cough. So come along on this journey with us as we discuss the things you might need to think about if you're possibly moving your wedding date, canceling your wedding, going forward with some modifications, or going forward as is. It's a complicated time, but above all else, just remember, "Don't Panic."
