This week, we're talking all about how you can avoid those sorts of awkward situations in your family photos and group shots at your wedding. There's always that one photo that you didn't really want, but maybe one of your family members wanted... and it's hard to know what to say and what to do on the day so that you don't offend anyone. Don't worry. We're here to help, and more importantly, hopefully your photographer and planner/coordinator will be there to help on the wedding day.
