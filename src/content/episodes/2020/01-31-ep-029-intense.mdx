This week we're answering random questions about wedding planning. First up, is it okay to switch wedding photographers if you find one or two you like more? Next, how do you deal with intense in-laws who put their foot down about petty things in facebook messenger? Finally, is it okay to skip your sibling's wedding if they snubbed your daughter while making their flower girl pick?
