This week we talked with Leila Breton of Curvy Custom Bride about wedding dresses. Leila makes dresses for brides, as long as they can come into her shop, so she can build their dress on them. Leila also talks to us about reading body language and paying attention to non-verbal communication so that you can better serve your clients. We also break away from wedding dresses for a bit to talk about steampunk Disney princess cosplay and Doctor Who.
