This week we delve into something a bit personal. Last year, Jenn found out she has an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto's Disease. We knew something was wrong for a while, but we didn't know what was wrong or what to do about it. So this week we're talking about what it's like to find out you have an autoimmune disease and what it's like supporting someone when they find that out.
